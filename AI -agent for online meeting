be aware of the bride dependencies and that's really a time and n.'s youtube also mention vessel with ties up for the edges of being recurring way it a kind of them are is that introduce new dependency is um make people feel all filled different feelings even might even in comparison silk in mars images like a thousand lines of code has changed like eddie and izzy is like an alien and know-how many why use of friends and co distinctly goodbye to such known that i'm someone who cares about right to be concerned about that love to look time the u. that detail how some flags for what has my big question to you would be what is like a good witness has four are adding any dependency of knowing as is pretty dead and is there like a jury of the project immaturity of the wrigley's lake is delighted we is the allowed to attend to want to use the highest really suffered we waited this time to see if security's off bubbles up from the releases and those yuri perspective was the good

under it's own lyric as c. news for sick or it goes up in but why is that loza reissued is just using the specific initiatives that makes it super critical so so we want to adelaide assertions that we're looking for our activity in the end and that is the way you have wanted and c. r. and one of our we see rendering ones in an minute in like eleven years i think i don't like that while i'm out on the panic button and then and so so we have so soft light at paris so you on some sort of active and once again by those are open sores brothers and one day that person might decide i'm not in

sorry that my whole life in this refile snug and so to throw up though i'm a person like yeah and the us doing this he assessed by a seat and here's your secrets that are recycled and i thought that sounds like odeon go no way that the czar's late using does is subset of the dependency ah yes isn't as using a glass or else so on something that goes wrong asleep year you so couple to lot of other pieces that could messages in the simpson yeah and synonymous with toys r. us are a choice and we had a singer wanted and this is a great only one well known general but um and we can reduce teacher from scratch ourselves so as i know we have to do that said i guess you know a question around is every situation where makes more sense a light breeze small enough was basically last as best question is i'm asking is where's that line up of thinking and that is source we should just we see is korea function using the same code paris's we should actually have a third grader tendency for those yeah i know i wish i had a minute has not he are in i read that was where another analysis reduced by ceiling and now yeah de israeli when we buy that from their ear or berserk especially when it's accept we have been burying the florist as i'm in the upper for a long time about lawless island some but i've seen gatorade the sincerely prolonging something would hate for us to implement somebody down so that it is as a power station island yeah i get that name is up and see is this little fifteen seconds but erode same side of the main this week ago and long-term when i went out and as we know them
